                    The great thing about the new A-Class isn’t just the MBUX  Mercedes-Benz User Experience, or the many personalisation options
                    it’s getting to know a car that gets to know you. The new A-Class is as youthful and dynamic as ever , but grown-up and
                    comfortable like never before.It completely redefines modern luxury in the compact class, and revolutionises interior design.
                    Technologically the new A-Class not only takes first place thanks to MBUX – Mercedes-Benz User Experience: it also offers a number of
                    functions that were previously the preserve of the luxury class. And although Mercedes-Benz has retained the sporty appearance, the utility value
                    has increased.The new A-Class can be ordered from March onwards, and the market launch commences in the spring.

                 <p class="pAh2">he purist, surface-accentuating design of the new A-Class is the next step in the Mercedes-Benz design philosophy of Sensual Purity. On the basis of a
                 compact two-box design, optimised dimensions and proportions have led to a new interpretation of the A-Class’s design. “With the fourth generation of the A-Class,
                 we are redefining modern luxury in the compact class. To do this we have opted for a combination of uncompromisingly dynamic design and an intuitive operating concept,”
                 says Britta Seeger, the member of the Daimler AG Board of Management responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars sales. “With MBUX – the new Mercedes-Benz User Experience – we are
                 creating a completely new customer experience.”

                                <p class="pBh1">The model update lends the B-Class a design that epitomises refined sportiness. The exterior displays cutting-edge dynamism and a unique emotional appeal.
                                This unusual blend is attributable to the organically designed front section. The sporty V-shape of the radiator grille and the bonnet merges into the striking front
                                bumper in soft nose design. The AMG Line optionally offers an even more powerful and sportier
                                version of this bumper. The optional LED high-performance headlamps provide for an even more striking design.
                                The “coming home” function creates an exceptional light scenario that ensures the vehicle stands apart even while still stationary.
                                The headlamps also offer excellent illumination of the road, a light colour similar to that of daylight and very low energy consumption.</p>

                                <p class="pBh2">The numerous assistance features on board the new B-Class, such as standard-fit COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS,
                                provide for a superlative standard of safety. COLLISION PREVENTION ASSIST PLUS combines a radar-based distance warning function with Adaptive
                                Brake Assist and autonomous partial braking to reduce the risk of rear-end collisions. Numerous optional systems are additionally available to further
                                ease the strain on the driver, to reduce the risk of accidents and to provide yet more effective protection for the vehicle’s occupants and other road users.
                                These include Traffic Sign Assist, the PRE-SAFE® system and Active Parking Assist with PARKTRONIC, for example. As such, the B-Class sets benchmarks in the compact
                                class and covers all phases of the Mercedes-Benz Integral Safety Concept in exemplary fashion. The B-Class paves the way for the best that lies ahead.

                                    elegant design with the brand’s hallmark Driving Performance and the advantages of an SUV. The 270 kW (367 PS) 3.0-litre V6 biturbo engine, the automatic transmission
                             9G-TRONIC with shortened shift times and the AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive configured with a rear bias form the basis for an especially dynamic on-road driving

                            chrome front splitter ensures an optimal flow of air to the cooling modules.</p>

                            functional black with red contrasting features is a characteristic element. Longitudinal-grain aluminium trim highlights the sporty aspirations.
                            The multifunction sports steering wheel in black leather with red contrasting topstitching and featuring a flattened bottom section is ideally suited to an emphatic
